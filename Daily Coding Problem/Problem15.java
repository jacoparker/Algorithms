// Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
// This problem was asked by Facebook.
// Given a stream of elements too large to store in memory, pick a random
// element from the stream with uniform probability.

class Problem15<E> {

    public static uniformSample(E dataBlock[]) {
        // retrieve 4KB data blocks one at a time

        // depending on datatype, calculate number of records

        // when number of records is determined, create random number
        // in range from 0 to dataSize

        // determine which block this index would result in and return the
        // item from that block
    }

    public static void main(String []args) {

    }

}
